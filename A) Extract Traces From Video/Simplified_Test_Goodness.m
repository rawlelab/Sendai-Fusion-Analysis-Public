% quantified.  The various tests are described below.  As part of the test,
% a gaussian fit is performed (this is done to ensure that the eccentricity
% and pixel values calculated for small particles are not incorrectly
% represented in samples where there are very big particles which dominate
% the original thresholding).

%doesn't pass the test, the function doesn't crash because its outputs are
%not defined.  These values will not be used if the particle doesn't pass
