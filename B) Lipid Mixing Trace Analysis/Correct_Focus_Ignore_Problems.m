% Focus problems are corrected by determining the difference in intensity 
% before and after the focus frame number (taking the median over some 
% number of frames before and after the focus frame number). This 
% difference is then subtracted from the intensity trace for all frame 
% numbers after the focus problem (essentially erasing the focus problem 
% from the trace which will be used to perform the analysis). The actual 
% frame number where the focus problem occurred is set to the median 
% intensity value before the focus event. Because no frames were deleted, 
% the time vector does not need to be modified

% NOTE: the numbers here are the shifted numbers (shifted to 
% account for time zero or other frames ignored at the beginning). They 
% will correspond to the frames as they appear in the traces within this 
% program, and not necessarily in the original data set in FIJI or whatever



% Ignore frame numbers are simply deleted from the trace, together with their 
% corresponding values in the time vector
